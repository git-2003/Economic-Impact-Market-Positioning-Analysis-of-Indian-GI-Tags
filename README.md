# Economic-Impact-Market-Positioning-Analysis-of-Indian-GI-Tags
This project presents an interactive dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI to analyze the economic impact, market positioning, and distribution of Indian Geographical Indication (GI) Tags.
The dashboard provides a clean and interactive view of how GI tags are distributed across states, categories, market types, and economic impact levels. The objective is to transform raw GI data into actionable visual insights through effective dashboard design and data modeling.
# 🎯 Objectives
## Analyze GI tags based on economic impact levels (High & Medium)
## Understand market positioning across Domestic, Export, and Cultural segments
## Visualize category concentration (Handicraft, Agricultural, Food Products, etc.)
## Identify state-wise distribution of GI tags
## Create a clean and user-friendly analytical dashboard

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
## Microsoft Power BI Desktop
## Power Query Editor (Data Transformation)
## DAX Measures
## Data Modeling
## Interactive Visual Design

# 📁 Dataset Description
The project uses two datasets:
## Master GI Data
## GI Tag Name
## State
## Category
## Market Type
## Production Scale
## Date of Filing
## GI Economic Impact Data
## GI Tag Name
## Economic Impact Level
Both tables were merged using Inner Join on GI_tag_name in Power Query Editor.

# 📊 Dashboard Features
## GI Tag slicer for interactive filtering
## Summary information panel for selected GI tag
## State-wise GI distribution (Horizontal Bar Chart)
## Market Type vs Economic Impact (Stacked Bar Chart)
## Economic Impact Distribution (Donut Chart)
## Category Distribution (Treemap)
## Visual focus interaction for better analytical clarity

# 🎨 Design Principles Used
## Consistent navy theme (#1F3A5F)
## Gold accent highlights for contrast
## Icon-based information panels for readability
## Minimal clutter with clear visual hierarchy
## Interactive filtering across visuals

# 📈 Key Insights
## High economic impact GI tags form the majority share.
## Handicraft and Agricultural categories dominate GI registrations.
## Certain states show strong GI concentration indicating regional specialization.
## Export-oriented market types often align with higher economic impact levels.
